    "# About Python\n",
    "\n",
    "[Python](https://www.python.org) is a widely used general-purpose open source programming language. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is used in almost all application domains including finance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python is one of the easier programming languages to get started with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a [high-level language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language) \n",
    "suitable for rapid development. \n",
    "\n",
    "It has a relatively small core language supported by many libraries, and it supports multiple programming styles (procedural, object-oriented, functional, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Features like iterators, generators, decorators and list comprehensions make Python highly expressive, \n",
    "allowing you to get more done with less code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scientific Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has become one of the core languages of scientific computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's either the dominant player or a major player in\n",

    "## Numerical Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Fundamental matrix and array processing capabilities are provided by the excellent [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) library. NumPy provides the basic array data type plus some simple processing operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org) library is built on top of NumPy and provides additional functionality.\n",
